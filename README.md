# kaggle-digit-recognition
This is [Kaggle's Digit Recognition competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview).

- `kaggle-digit-classification.ipynb` contains the steps I followed for my first submission, where I built, compiled and trained a deeply connected neural network to make predictions;
- `kaggle-CNN-digit-classification.ipynb`: here I used a Convolutional Neural Network to improve my score.
